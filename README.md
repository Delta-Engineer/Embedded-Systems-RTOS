# Embedded-Systems-RTOS
Program that uses RTOS on GPIO pin to switch between task & priorities

# Getting Started
To get started make sure that you have STM32CubeIDE installed. Etiher export the entire project or use the code from the Core file. 

# Exporting project
If you have the IDE setup, export the core file, and if you don't have the FreeRTOS library, export it as well, and then look through the code. The reason why is because if you are using a different STM microcontroller, the output pins must be configured in the ioc file. If you have the same microcontroller, then you can just use PingPong.ioc file attached in the repository.

# Built With
STM32CubeIDE - The IDE used ; STM32L476RGT - The microcontroller used

# Versioning
Version 1.0

# Authors
Harmon Singh - Initial work See also the list of contributors who participated in this project.

Hat tip to anyone who uses the code =) or have any comments =)... Inspiration etc
